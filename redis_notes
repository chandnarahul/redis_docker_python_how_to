Redis Notes

Redis, which stands for REmote DIctionary Server
 Redis developers can leverage data structures like 
 strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets 
 using commands similar to the collection operations in most programming languages. 
 Redis has replication capabilities, a server-side scripting language (Lua), 
 transactions, and different modes of disk persistence.
